API Reference
=============

This section of the documentation is devoted to describing the components of
``anomalearn``. A list of public classes, interfaces and functions of
``anomalearn`` is accessible. Private attributes,
methods or functions are not shown in this reference and are not treated since
they are highly subject to change.

Please consider these components to be partially stable, this version of
``anomalearn`` is a pre-alpha. However, content published in this version could
be considered relatively stable. Major modifications should happen only with
new content introduction.

Beside the strictly-speaking autogenerated documentation, the other sections
of the API Reference describe in detail the implementation of each
component, and how it should be used.
