.. _release_0.0.1:

=======================
Pre-alpha version 0.0.1
=======================

This has been the very first version published on
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/anomalearn/>`_. Being anomalearn a project
born in the context of a Marco Petri's Master of Science thesis, it was
necessary to register the name before actually publishing the content of the
thesis. Therefore, this version does not contain code since it was needed only
to accomplish with bureaucracy.
