Developer guide
===============

This section of the documentation is devoted to guides for developers who want
to contribute to ``anomalearn``. A complete list of all documented classes,
functions, and attributes is accessible. In this reference API also private
components are listed since the developer must be able to explore every piece of
the library comfortably.

The guides contain both the complete autogenerated documentation and guides
related on how to contribute, the tools used for contributing, guidelines for
issuing problems, and instructions on how to discuss new features to add.

Each type of contribution il welcomed and well accepted, from small bug fixes,
enhancement of tests, improvements to existing functions and methods,
performance improvements, and many others. If you want to add a functionality,
please, visit the `discussions <https://github.com/marcopetri98/anomalearn/discussions>`_
page on github and give your own ideas!
