"""Testing package for anomalearn.

This testing package contains all the testing utilities used to test the
functionalities of the library. The testing of this library follows a hybrid
integration testing method. Some methods are tested bottom-up using drivers, and
some others are tested top-down using stubs. Finally, the models are tested
together to perform integration testing.
